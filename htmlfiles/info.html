			<h3> Robotics Software Information : </h3>
			
			<ul>
				<li> Intelligent interfaces : <p>We are seeing a move away from traditional graphical user interfaces (GUIs) 
				towards more intelligent interfaces that make it easier for humans to interact with robots. 
				Intelligent interfaces can take many forms,such as voice-activated commands, gesture control, 
				and even brain-computer interfaces.</p> </li>
				
				<br >
				<li> Simplified programming : <p>The days of complex robotic programming languages are numbered. 
				Thanks to advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, it is now possible to program robots 
				using more natural language constructs.This makes it easier for non-experts 
				to program robots, and opens up new possibilities for how robots can be used. </p> </li>
				
				<br>
				<li> Machine learning : <p>Machine learning (ML) is being used to enable robots to learn from
				data and experiences, just like humans do. This is resulting in more intelligent and adaptive 
				robots that can carry out tasks more effectively. ML is also being used to improve the accuracy 
				of robot sensors, making them better at avoiding obstacles and detecting objects. </p> </li>

			<h3> Robotics Hardware Information : </h3>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Foldable robots : <p>One of the most significant hardware trends in recent years
				has been the development of foldable robots. These are machines that can change their shape
				or size, making them more versatile and adaptable than ever before. </p> </li>
				
				<br >
				<li> Mechanical dexterity : <p> Another major trend in robotics hardware is the development 
				of machines with incredible mechanical dexterity. These machines are able to handle delicate tasks with 
				ease, thanks to their advanced sensors and articulated limbs. </p> </li>
				
				<br>
				<li> Collaborative robots : <p>One of the most exciting trends in robotics is the rise of collaborative robots, 
				or cobots. Cobots are designed to work alongside humans, and they are becoming increasingly popular in a wide range 
				of industries. </p> </li>
